# MiniRT
Simple C ray tracer.

### basic

- [ ] Inter should take *ray instead of ray


- [X] parsing : filter number of coma

- [X] Create Camera and iterate over pixels
- [X] Create scene and calculate intersections of rays and objects
  - [X] Sphere
    - [X] basic intersection
	- [X] only spheres in front of cam
	- [X] shading
	- [X] light level
	- [X] ray rebound
  - [X] Cylinder
  - [X] Wall

- [] Parsing
	- [X] handle empty file


### bonuses list

 - [X] phong
 - [ ] colored and multi spot lighs
 - [ ] cube / cone
 - [ ] diffusion
 - [ ] multithreading

Other ideas :
 - [ ] Patterns (perlin)

### end
 - [ ] remove all asserts
 - [ ] remove time.h and timing in main
 - [ ] remove PRINT_DEBUG


### Completed Column âœ“
- [X] Add error handling to init functions

With malloc in render_pixel():
	total 2,560,584 allocs.
	runs in ~ 0.1s
Without malloc in render_pixel():
	total 587 allocs.
	runs in ~ 0.05s

(this test was with about 5 mallocs per pixel at the start.)

without malloc, render logic is 2x faster so we'll make sure to use only stack allocation inside the render logic as much as possible.
