With malloc in render_pixel():
	total 2,560,584 allocs.
	runs in ~ 0.1s
Without malloc in render_pixel():
	total 587 allocs.
	runs in ~ 0.05s

(this test was with about 5 mallocs per pixel at the start.)

without malloc, render logic is 2x faster so we'll make sure to use only stack allocation inside the render logic as much as possible.
